CONSENSUS TREE
--------------

Consensus tree is constructed from 100 bootstrap trees
Robinson-Foulds distance between ML tree and consensus tree: -1

Branches with bootstrap support >0.00000000% are kept (extended consensus)
Branch lengths are optimized by maximum likelihood on original alignment
Numbers in parentheses are bootstrap supports (%)
